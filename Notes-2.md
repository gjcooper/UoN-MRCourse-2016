## Follow-ups

Types of experiments where exact knowledge of HRF important
	* Timing - activity in one part of brain happened before anotyher part of brain)
	* Dynamic Causal modelling

## Inference

Basic types of experimental designs
Claims about groups vastly different about a claim about an individual person.

#### Prototypical experiment

Brian Dougall had less of response to emotional faces, therefore psychopath (within the amygdala)
Fearful faces as *compared* to neutral faces.
For every point in the brain (univariate staittical test) compare signal from fearful face to neutral face
Set a threshold to only show points of difference above threshold
Smooth the data in space (done in raw data rather than processed) - improves statitical power
Show on anatomical data, digital reconstruction in 3D for display.
Each step is well justified statistically.

### To look at
Multi-voxel pattern analysis
