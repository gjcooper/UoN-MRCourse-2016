#Day 3 Notes

## Visual areas from fMRI

Fusiform Face Area
Lateral Occipital Complex (Visual formed object recognition)
Visual word form area

###Carry over designs

3 Types of measures
  * BOLD fMRI amplitude (Increase of amplitude in realtion to contrast, particular object/stimulus) *Average direct effect of stimulus*
  * *Distributed Pattern Analysis* Patterns of voxel activation within group correlated, but between groups not correlated. Pattern of direct effects across voxels (not average)
  * *Within voxel adaptation* Neurons have reduced response to repetition of stimulus. Neural adaptation studies, looking at modulatory effect of one stimulus on the next.

Continuous carry-over designs, a method to silmultaneously and efficiently measure within-voxel adaptation effects and across voxel distributed pattern responses. Order of stimuli serially counter-balanced, continuous presentation, no stimulus pairing.
Neural response to stimulus @ time = sum of mean response, direct effect (distributed pattern analysis) and influence of prior stimulus (within voxel neural adaptation)
Tyoes of modulatory effects:
  * Neural adaptation, linear adaptation, has property that it's symmetric
  * Bias effects, asymmetric

Counterbalancing can be done with de Bruijn cycles.

Must control for different sized sets of stimuli.

### Applications of carry over designs

Integral (Euclidean) dimensions, not automatically seen as different things (colour = hue + brightness)
Separable (city-block) dimensions seen as different things (colour + shape != anything)

Garner Interference is when when two judgement calls are integral and there is cross talk.

Hypothesis, integral spaces are represented by conjointly tuned neurons. separables spcaces represented by independently tuned neurons.
