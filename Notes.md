# Freeform Topuic Ideas

* Power Analysis
* Resting State fMRI
* Noise sources and more
* Physics/Nitty Gritty

# Expansion

## Power Analysis

Neuropowertools(.com)? To check power for a study based on pilot data or similar
Neurovault(.com?) to access previous study data and results.

## Resting State

Head motion is important

## Noise

Cardio-Pulmanary Fluctuations

## NittyGritty

* B0 is direction of magnetic field
* M0 is average direction of alignment of protons within b0

## Logistics etc

* Adding a marker for side of head, neurological/radiological views of head orientation
