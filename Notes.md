## Power Analysis

Neuropowertools(.com)? To check power for a study based on pilot data or similar
Neurovault(.com?) to access previous study data and results.

## Resting State

Head motion is important

## Noise

* Cardio-Pulmanary Fluctuations
* Distortion due to ferro-magnetic substance prescence
* Susceptibility artifact - distortion due to air/fluid/flesh boundaries (sinuses, ear canals - important for auditory lobes)


## NittyGritty

* B0 is direction of magnetic field
* M0 is average direction of alignment of protons within b0
* T1, T2, T2\* (fMRI)
  * T2\* is component that does not re-phase after 180 degree pulse (T2 dephase, T2\* is component that does not refocus)
  * Microscopic distortions of magnetic field cause the T2\* component, one source of this is blood
  * BOLD - Blood oxygen level dependant fMRI due to oxygen attached to hemoglobin, as oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin have differnt magnetic properties
  * At each point in fMRI image, it represents amount of distortion
  * Blood vessels increase in size with activity.
  * Activity -> Increase blood vessel size -> more deoxyhemoglobin -> change in magnetic local properties as measured by T2\* -> Image
* Scanner with larger gradient coil strengths that can change configuration quickly are best for fMRI

## Logistics etc

* Adding a marker for side of head, neurological/radiological views of head orientation

## Auditory

* Noise from the scanner (gradient coils) interferes with auditory experiments

## General

* Brain activity -> fMRI Image mostly a linear system
* Stimulation -> Brain activity is non-linear
* BOLD is slow, averaged out response compared to neuron spikes
